Language is much more than just words, it is the single thing that can unite people, join the hearts of different and alike. It plays a vital role in our everyday lives and use it more than we imagine. The language English is spoken by billions of people all around the world , yet only a few appreciate the beauty of the language. To see the beauty, we must be able to first understand the language and use it without mistakes. If I was to say what kind of people appreciate the language most, it had to be the poets, the way they present the beauty of the language and make a person just fall in love with the language is truly incredible. They have a way with the words, they can paint a picture with the language, make a person feel as if they are right there beside the poet.
